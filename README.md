# Past-Projects
Two recent projects I completed during my time at University of Leicester.

Wireworld Simulator is the tool I built as my final project to accompany my dissertation on cellular automata.
The rules for the Wireworld automata can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld

Encrypted message server allows clients to encrypt, send and decrypt messages over a server, as well as signing the message to ensure authenticity. 
The software utilises several cryptographic algorithms: AES-256 encryption, the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, and RSA public key cryptography.
